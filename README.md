# SQL_Data_Cleaning_Project

## 📖 Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real-world layoffs dataset for further analysis. The goal is to handle missing values, standardize inconsistent data, and ensure the dataset is analysis-ready. 

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- MySQL
- SQL (Data Cleaning Techniques)
- Data Wrangling Skills

## 📂 Project Structure
- Get the dataset from [here](https://github.com/wael9922/Excel_Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/main/Datasets)  

- `layoffs_data_set_cleaning_project.sql` : SQL script containing all data cleaning steps and transformations.

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Applied
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize and simplify complex queries
- Window Functions for identifying duplicates and ranking data
- Conditional Aggregations for handling missing values
- String Functions for standardizing textual data
- Date Functions to handle and correct date formats
- Filtering, Joins, and Subqueries for efficient data transformation

## 📊 Results
- Missing data handled and filled appropriately.
- Duplicates removed.
- Data fields standardized for consistent analysis.
- Dataset is now clean and ready for deep analysis or visualization projects.

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset.
- Create visualizations showing layoff trends by company, industry, country, etc.
- Build a dashboard (using Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries).
